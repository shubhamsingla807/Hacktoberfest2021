// Problem statement - To Swap the values of two variables without using any extra variable.
// Solution - There are multiple methods to solve the problems like using arithmetic operators, using bitwise XOR. But here I'm doing it via arithmetic operators.
// The idea is to get a sum in one of the two given numbers. The numbers can then be swapped using the sum and subtraction from the sum. 

// C++ Program to swap two numbers without any other variable 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x = 10, y = 5;

	// Code to swap 'x' and 'y'
	x = x + y; // x now becomes 15
	y = x - y; // y becomes 10
	x = x - y; // x becomes 5
	cout << "After Swapping: x =" << x << ", y=" << y;
}
